# This piece is to substitute the default behaviour with your own script,
#   perl, or C program.
#
# You can customize every single command creating an executable file (may be a
#   script or a compiled program) and calling it the same as the $1 parameter
#   passed by apcupsd to this script.
#
# After executing your script, apccontrol continues with the default action.
#   If you do not want apccontrol to continue, exit your script with exit 
#   code 99. E.g. "exit 99".
#
# WARNING: please be aware that if you add any commands before the shutdown
#   in the downshutdown) case and your command errors or stalls, it will
#   prevent your machine from being shutdown, so test, test, test to
#   make sure it works correctly.
#
# The apccontrol file with no extension will be rebuilt (overwritten)
#   every time that "make" is invoked if you are working with the
#   source files. Thus if you build from a source distribution, we
#   recommend you make your changes to the apccontrol.in file.
