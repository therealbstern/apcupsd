<H1>Master/Slave Configuration</H1>
<h2>General</h2>
If you have two or more computers that are powered by the same
UPS and they are connected by a network, you can configure 
<b>apcupsd</b> so that the computer that controls the UPS
(connected by the serial port or USB port), which is called
the master, can provide information to other machines powered
by the UPS, called slaves. When the master detects a power 
failure, it will notify all the slaves (maximum of twenty).
If the master detects that the battery is low, it will also
notify the slave so that the slave may perform a shutdown.
<p>In addition, in cases where you wish to keep the master
up longer than the slave, you can configure the slave to
shutdown in a predetermined time after the UPS goes on
batteries.
<p>
If a picture is worth a thousand words for you, please see
the <a href="configure.html#ConfigTypes">Three Major Configuration
Possibilities for Apcupsd</a> section of the Configuration chapter
of this manual.
<h2>Configuration Directives</h2>
The minimum set of configuration directive changes needed to
create a proper master and slave configuration files is
described in the <a href="config-examples.html">Configuration
Examples</a> section of this manual.
<p>
The details of these directives is explained in
the <a href="configure.html#UPS_Sharing">UPS Sharing</a> section
of the Configuration chapter of this document.
<p>
In addition, sample master and slave configuration files can
be found in the &lt;src&gt;/examples directory (<b>apcupsd.master.conf</b>
and <b>apcupsd.slave.conf</b>).
<h2>Master/Slave Problems</h2>
If you are having problems getting a master/slave configuration
to work, or you are getting error messages, please see the
<a href="troubles.html">Trouble Shooting Apcupsd</a> Chapter
of this manual for more details.
<h2>Master/Slave Shutdown</h2>
For additional details of shutting down a master/slave configuration,
please see the <a href="shutdown.html#MasterSlaveShutdown">Master/Slave
Shutdown</a> section of the Shutdown chapter of this manual.

<h2>Master/Slave Networking using NIS and the NET Driver</h2>
It is also possible to implement a network of master/slave
apcupsds using the new 3.10.x code and the <b>net</b> driver.
This mode of master/slave networking is considerably different
from the old method described at the beginning of this chapter.
In the old code, there is a lot of configuration on both the
master and slave side, and the master polls or sends info
to the slave.
<p>
In this master/slave mode, the master is a standard stand alone
configuration except that it must have <b>NETSERVER on</b>
in the configuration file and have an <b>NISPORT nnn</b> defined.
Thus any apcupsd running in this mode then becomes the master.  
<p>
The slave then uses the net driver to connect to the master's
NIS output.  In this mode, the slave decides how often to
poll the master for the NIS information. The
slave copy of apcupsd, have <b>UPSTYPE net</b>, which will invoke
the &quot;network&quot; driver. By setting this machine's <b>DEVICE</b>
to be  <b>master-ip:master-NIS-port</b>
it will automatically connect
to the master and use the master's signals to shutdown the computer.
In the example net slave configuration file below, the slave 
uses the NIS information provided by the computer <b>tibs</b>
on port <b>3551</b>.
