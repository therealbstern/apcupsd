This feature is somewhat outdated and not often used.
<h3>DATA logging</h3>
Data logging consists of periodically logging important data concerning
the operation of the UPS. For the definitive definition of the format,
see log_data() in apcreports.c. The format varies according to the UPS
model and the information available from the UPS. 
<p>For UPS models,
NBKPRO, SMART, SHARESMART, and MATRIX, the output is
written in a format very similar to what PowerChute writes. That is:
<p>
MinLineVoltage, MaxLineVoltage, OutputVoltage, BatteryVoltage, 
LineFrequency, UPSTemperature,AmbientTemperature,Humidity,LineVoltage
<p>
Any value that is not supported by your UPS such as
AmbientTemperature and Humidity will be blank; the commas before
and after that field will still be output. 
<p>An actual example from the log file is:
<pre> Nov  2 12:43:05 matou apcupsd[23439]: 224.9,227.5,226.2,27.74,50.00,100.0,30.6,,,226.2
