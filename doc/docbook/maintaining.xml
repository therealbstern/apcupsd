<chapter id='maintaining'><title>Maintaining Your UPS</title>

<para>If you have your UPS long enough, you will probably have battery
problems. Below, you will find some suggestions for replacing
batteries. One <emphasis>important</emphasis> note of caution: at
least one user purchased one of the non-APC batteries noted below and
found out that they would not fit into his unit. This required cutting
and soldering and other very undesirable things, so be extremely
careful in measuring the batteries including every millimeter of the
terminal connections which can cause problems.</para>

<para>Although you can do a hot swap of your batteries while the
computer is running, it may not be very satisfactory because the unit
will not know that the batteries have been swapped and apcupsd will
continue to show Low Battery.  To correct this situation, you must do a
discharge and recharge of the battery followed by a battery
recalibration using <application>apctest</application>.  At that point
the battery should be calibrated better.  As noted below, Carl has found
that it takes several discharge/charges before the runtime calibration
is accurate.  Take care not to discharge your battery too much as it
tends to shorten the battery life.</para>

<sect1><title>What Various People Have to Say about Batteries</title>

<para>Here is what John Walker has to say about APC UPS batteries:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>I thought I'd pass on some information I've obtained which
you'll probably eventually need. Besides, by writing it down I'll be
able to find it the next time. I started installing mine in
1995-1996. Lead-acid batteries have a finite life even if not
subjected to deep discharge cycles. For the batteries used by APC,
this is typically four to six years. As part of the self-test cycle,
the UPS measures the voltage of the battery at full charge (which
falls as the battery ages), and if it's below about 90% of the value
for a new battery, it sets off the &quot;Replace battery&quot; alarm,
which it repeats every day. [on apcupsd versions prior to 3.8.0, this
message is sent once, on version 3.8.0, it is sent every 9 hours -
KES]. You will occasionally get a false alarm. It's a good idea if you
get an alarm to repeat the self-test the next day and see if the alarm
goes away. If the alarm is persistent, you need to replace the
batteries, which can be done without powering down the UPS or load-you
just open up the battery door, take out the old batteries, and hook up
the new ones.</para>

<para>APC makes &quot;Replacement Battery Units&quot; for each of the
SmartUPS models, but they sell them directly only in the U.S.</para>

<para>It's best to wait until the low battery alarm before ordering a
replacement-keeping batteries on the shelf reduces their life unless
you keep them fully charged.</para>
</blockquote>

<para>And Andr&#xE9; Hendrick says:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>[For replacement batteries] You need to goto you your local
Yamaha SeaDoo shop. There are 35 AMP Hour deep cycle marine batteries
that are direct replacements. These are gel-cel and will double the
runtime and/or cut your recharge time in half.</para>

<para>Finally, here is what Carl Erhorn has to say about
batteries:</para>

<blockquote>
  <para>Hi, Folks.</para>

  <para>Well, Kern was absolutely right. The problem with my UPS was
batteries. It was unexpected though, because there was no
indication of a bad battery right up until the UPS failed
entirely.</para>

  <para>For those who might encounter the same thing, and don't know
what's happening (I didn't either), here's what happened.</para>

  <para>A week or so ago, I turned on one of my SmartUPS 700-NET models.
The load is a small dual P-III unix server (Solaris 8, X86) and a
4MM tape drive. During the normal selftest that runs when you first
turn on any APC UPS, the UPS 'freaked out'. The alarm stuttered at
about 4 or 5 beeps per second, and all the panel lights flashed
spasmodically, as if something was loose inside the UPS.</para>

  <para>I turned off the UPS and it's load, then turned the UPS on
again. This time, everything seemed fine. I booted the system that
was attached, and there were no problems. The status monitor showed
9 minutes runtime (which indicates fairly low capacity), but the
batteries showed fully charged. I began to suspect a bad inverter
in the UPS.</para>

  <para>However, Kern told me that he suspected the batteries. So I took
the UPS offline, put an old SU-600 in it's place (just barely big
enough to handle the startup peaks - I get an 'overload' lamp lit
for about 2 seconds during boot), and checked out the batteries.
They did indicate that they were near the end of life, so I ordered
a replacement set. Those came in on Friday, and after the initial
charge, a complete charge/discharge cycle to recalibrate the UPS,
and some testing, I put it back in service.</para>

  <para>Surprise! (Or maybe not?) Kern was right - there is nothing
wrong with the inverter or the charging circuit, and the new cells
fixed everything.</para>

  <para>What confused me is that there was no 'replace battery'
indication from the UPS, even when it failed, plus a fair amount of
runtime indicated with a full charge. So if you see such behavior
on one of your UPS models, it makes sense to replace the batteries,
even if there is no indication that the batteries have failed
yet.</para>

  <para>One of the things I learned during this process is that the UPS
internal calibration will lose accuracy over the life of the
battery. I always do a recalibrate when I install new cells, but
rarely do it after that, as it's time-consuming, and you really
can't use the system attached to the UPS while doing it. Since my
systems are almost constantly in use, it's a pain to schedule a
recal, and I tend to put it off. This time it bit me. I'd suggest
that folks do a recal at least once every six months. It will make
your runtime estimates much more accurate, and also allows you to
keep track of the state of your batteries.</para>

  <para>For those who don't know how to do this, here's what you do.
This proceedure should not be confused with the 'Recalibrate'
feature in the APC PowerchutePlus software. They do not do the same
thing.</para>

  <para>&gt;From APC's web site:</para>

  <para>Perform a Runtime Calibration. This is a manual procedure and
should not be confused with the runtime calibration performed
through PowerChute plus. The batteries inside of the Smart-UPS are
controlled by a microprocessor within the UPS. Sometimes it is
necessary to reset this microprocessor, especially after the
installation of new batteries. Stop the PowerChute plus software
from running and disconnect the serial cable. There must be at
least a 30% load attached to the UPS during this procedure, but the
process will cause the UPS to shut off and cut power to its
outlets. Therefore, attach a non-critical load to the UPS and then
force the UPS on battery by disconnecting it from utility power.
Allow the unit to run on battery until it turns off completely.
Make sure a 30% load is present! Plug the UPS back into the wall
outlet and allow it to recharge (it will recharge more quickly
turned off and with no load present). Once the unit has recharged,
the &quot;runtime remaining&quot; calculation should be more accurate.
Remember that if the unit is an older model, then the runtime will
not improve significantly.</para>

  <para>Background:</para>

  <para>An APC Smart-UPS has a microprocessor which calculates runtime
primarily based on the load attached to the UPS and on its battery
capacity. On the right side of the front display panel there is a
vertical graph of five LEDs. Each LED is an indication of battery
charge in increments of twenty percent: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100%
(bottom to top). For example, if the battery charge is 99%, then
only four of the five LEDs are illuminated.</para>

  <para>To ensure that an operating system receives a graceful shutdown
when using PowerChute plus or a SmartSlot accessory, an alert is
generated by the Smart-UPS indicating that the UPS has reached a
low battery condition. The alert is audible (rapid beeping), visual
(flashing battery LED or LEDs), and readable through the graphical
interface of PowerChute plus software (or a native UPS shutdown
program within a particular operating system.) In order to
calculate this &quot;low battery condition,&quot; all Smart-UPS products have
a preconfigured low battery signal warning time of two minutes
(this is the factory default setting). There are a total of four
user-changeable settings: 2, 5, 7, or 10 minutes. If the low
battery signal warning time is set for 2 minutes, then the alerts
will activate simultaneously two minutes prior to shutdown.
Similarly, if the total runtime for a particular UPS is 30 minutes
with a low battery signal warning time set at 10 minutes, then the
UPS will run on battery for 20 minutes before the low battery alert
begins.</para>

  <para>Total runtime is primarily based on two factors, battery
capacity and UPS load. UPS load and runtime on battery are
inversely proportional: as load increases, battery runtime
decreases and vice versa. When utility power is lost, the UPS
begins discharging the battery in order to support the attached
load. Once power returns, the Smart-UPS will automatically begin to
recharge its battery.</para>

  <para>My comments on this proceedure:</para>

  <para>I believe this proceedure works for all APC models that calulate
runtime, not just the SmartUPS. It's important that you load the
UPS to 30% of the UPS capacity, as reported by apcupsd or another
UPS monitor program. I've found that normal house lamps of
different wattages allow me to adjust the load to almost exactly
what I want, which is between 30% and 35% of the UPS capacity. This
is critical te getting an accurate reading (according to the APC
web documents). Always bring the UPS to 100% charge first, as
indicated by the front panel lamps, or your UPS monitoring
software.</para>

  <para>Set the UPS shutdown time to 2 minutes, all other settings to
nominal, and disconnect the serial port cable from the UPS before
running the recalibration. If you leave a monitoring program
running through the serial port, it will turn the UPS off early,
and you don't want to do that during a recalibration run. When the
run is complete, and the UPS turns off, you can reattach the serial
cable, and the normal loads, and recharge the batteries normally.
If you think you might have a power outage during the recharge
time, allow the UPS to recharge to 20% or so (indicated by the
panel lamps) before trying to use the computer system. This will
allow the UPS to handle short dropouts while it recharges. Of
course, if you can leave the computer off during the recharge time,
the UPS will recharge much faster.</para>

  <para>As an aside, when the batteries failed, my total runtime at 100%
charge and an idle state was 9 minutes, which is pretty bad. I
replaced the batteries with extended capacity cells, which add
about 15% to the stock capacity. Now, after two complete charge/
discharge cycles, 100% charge shows the available runtime to be 42
minutes on the system when it's idle, and 33 minutes when the
system is very busy. The differences are due to the load of the
computer, when the disks are busy, and the cpus are not in a halted
state (my system halts the cpus when they are idle, to save power
and lower heat, as do other OS like Linux), when compared to an
idle state. Apcupsd indicates the load is about 27% when idle, and
as much as 37% when heavily loaded.</para>

  <para>I've found that two charge/discharge cycles result in a more
accurate recalibration when installing new cells. It appears that
some batteries need to be put through a couple of complete cycles
before they reach their full capacity. I've also noticed that the
full-charge voltage is different for each battery until they have
been through two cycles. On the initial charge of my new batteries,
the 100% charge voltage on the two cells was almost .5 VDC apart.
After two complete cycles, the batteries measure within .01 VDC of
each other!</para>

  <para>I hope this information helps anyone who might encounter the
problem I saw, and also shows folks how to recal their batteries.
If you haven't done a complete recalibration in a year or two, I'd
recommend it, so that you have warning of a low battery instead of
what happened to me.</para>

<sect1><title>Where Carl Suggests You Get Batteries</title>
<blockquote>

  <para>Hi, Folks.</para>

  <para>I'm just replacing the batteries in one of my SmartUPS models,
and it occurs to me that some of you may not know about the place I
get them from. I have no relationship with this company, other than
as a customer, but I feel they know what they are doing, their
prices are fair, and they have some interesting batteries available
that you can't obtain from APC.</para>

  <para>These are the reasons I use them, and I thought this information
might be useful to the US list members. They will ship outside of
the US. If you have questions, you can contact them through the
email address listed on their web pages. They have always responded
pretty quickly to my questions.</para>

  <para>The company is called Battery Wholesale Distributors, and they
are located in Georgetown, Texas. If you have questions, you can
reach them by phone at (800) 365-8444, 9:00AM to 5:00PM (their
local time), Monday through Friday. I've gotten email from them on
the weekends, although the office is not open then.</para>

  <para>I won't post prices, as you can get current pricing from their
web site. They have an entire section dedicated to APC replacement
batteries, and it's easy to find what you need. You can order over
the web, or by phone. They accept all the usual credit cards.</para>

  <para>The web site (as you might guess) is: <ulink
url="http://www.batterywholesale.com">www.batterywholesale.com</ulink></para>

  <para>The thing I really like is that they have found manufacturers
who make batteries in the standard case sizes, but have additional
capacity over the original batteries shipped with the APC UPS
models. Often, the difference is as much as 15% or so, and this can
result in additional runtime. It's a nice upgrade for a minor
increase in price.</para>

  <para>They are also 'green-aware', in that they encourage you to
recycle your old batteries, and will accept the old batteries back
from you if you cannot find a local place that recycles them. You
pay the shipping, but I think other than that, there is no charge.
I've never done this, as I have a battery retailer just down the
street who will accept my old batteries.</para>

  <para>Anyway, if you didn't know about these folks, put the info aside
where you can find it when you need replacement batteries. I won't
make any guarantees, but I've been very pleased with their
products, service, and pricing. I hope you find them as helpful to
you as I do. I've been dealing with them since about 1994, and have
never been disappointed. The owner of the place also is very good
on technical issues, so if you have questions on their products, he
can get as technical as you need to go.</para>
